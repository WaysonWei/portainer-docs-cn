# Environment-related

In Portainer terms, an _environment_ is an instance that you want to manage through Portainer. Environments can be Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, ACI or a combination. One Portainer Server instance can manage multiple environments.


Endpoints were renamed to Environments in version 2.10.
