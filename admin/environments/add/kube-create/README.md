# Create a Kubernetes cluster

With Portainer Business Edition you can create a Kubernetes cluster on your existing infrastructure directly from the Portainer UI.&#x20;


Portainer connects to your infrastructure and deploy Kubernetes and the Portainer Agent. You can provide your credentials during the deployment or set them up ahead of time in [Shared credentials](../../../settings/credentials/).


At present, we support deploying Talos Kubernetes via Omni and MicroK8s via SSH:


[omni.md](omni.md)



[microk8s](microk8s/)
