# API documentation

Portainer exposes an HTTP API that you can use to automate everything you do via the Portainer UI. You can also use Portainer as a gateway (HTTP queries against the Portainer API) to the underlying Docker/Kubernetes API.

You will need an access token in order to use the Portainer API. If you have not already set up an access token for the API, we have [instructions on how to do so](access.md).

You can find our API documentation at SwaggerHub:

* [Community Edition (CE) 2.27.6 API Documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/portainer/portainer-ce/2.27.6)

We have also provided some examples of API usage.
