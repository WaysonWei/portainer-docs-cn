# Switching to Portainer Business Edition

It’s easy and quick to upgrade from Portainer CE (both 1.x and 2.x branches) to Portainer Business Edition without losing your data. The following instructions apply whether you’re using a 5 node free license or you’ve purchased a license for Portainer Business Edition.

From version 2.17, you can upgrade your Portainer CE installation to Portainer BE from within Portainer itself.
