# Add an Ingress using a manifest

There are two ways to add a new ingress: [manually by using a form](add.md) or automatically by using a manifest. This article explains how to add an ingress using a manifest.


Manifests aren't just for Ingresses - you can also deploy namespaces, ConfigMaps, secrets and volumes using a manifest.


From the menu expand **Networking**, select **Ingresses** then click **Create from manifest**.
